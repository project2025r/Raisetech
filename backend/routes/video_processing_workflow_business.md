# Video Processing Workflow Visibility: 

This document explains, what happens after you upload a video for pavement defect analysis. 

---

## 1. **Video Upload (with 1-Minute Limit)**
- You upload a video of a road or pavement through our platform, either from your device or using the live camera feature.
- **Please note:** There is a 1-minute cap on the length of videos you can upload or record live. This ensures fast, efficient processing and a smooth experience. Once you process a video, you can upload or capture next 1 minute video for processing.
- Your name, role, and the location of the video, along with the video itself, are sent to the backend for processing.

---

## 2. **Model Selection & Start Processing**
- You choose which types of defects you want to detect (potholes, cracks, kerbs, or all).
- The system will only look for the types you select. If you select "All," every type of defect will be detected and tracked in your video.
- Once you have made your selection, you must click **Start Processing** to begin the analysis.

---

## 3. **Secure Storage**
- The original and processed videos are safely stored in the cloud (Amazon S3), ensuring they are backed up and available for future reference.

---

## 4. **Automated Video Analysis**
- Our system examines your video one frame at a time using advanced AI models, based on your selection.
- Each detected defect is assigned a unique ID, and relevant measurements (such as size, severity, and location) are generated for every detection.
- The system tracks each defect throughout the video, so you get a complete picture of all issues found.

---

## 5. **Live Progress Updates**
- As the video is being processed, you receive live updates and can see the results in real time.
- You can watch the detection process as it happens, frame by frame.

---

## 6. **Results and Reporting**
- When processing is complete, you receive:
  - A summary of all detected defects, including their IDs and detailed metrics (measurements and locations)
  - The processed video is saved securely in the cloud.
  - Links to download or view both the original and processed videos will be available in future updates

---

## 7. **Data Storage and Access**
- All results and videos are securely stored for future access and reporting.
- You can retrieve past analyses.

---

## 8. **Reliability and Error Handling**
- If anything goes wrong (e.g., a video can't be processed), you are notified, and the system records the issue for support follow-up.

---

## 9. **Future Improvements**
- The system will be designed to learn and improve over time, providing more accurate and valuable insights as more videos are processed.

---

## **Summary Flow**

1. **Upload Video (max 1 min)** → 2. **Select Models & Start Processing** → 3. **Cloud Storage** → 4. **Automated Analysis** → 5. **Live Results** → 6. **Summary Report** → 7. **Secure Access**

---

## **Business Value**
- **Faster Inspections:** Automated analysis saves time compared to manual review.
- **Objective Results:** AI provides consistent, unbiased defect detection.
- **Actionable Insights:** Detailed reports help prioritize repairs and maintenance.
- **Audit Trail:** All data is securely stored for compliance and future reference.
- **Transparency:** You can track progress and access results at any time.
